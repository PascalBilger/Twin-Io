ADC: 
MCP3561/2/4R
ADS131M04
ads1258

Opamp: 
AD620 works for sure, costs 10.-
INA126 might work too, costs 2.7CHF

Different leads are measured at different times with usual ECG.

Maybe set reference to average of RR, RL, LA, LL and record all voltages to have as much data as possible.

Frequency: 0.05-100Hz
https://www.analog.com/en/resources/analog-dialogue/articles/ecg-front-end-design-simplified.html

Noise over the 150Hz bandwidth should be 30uVRMS max
